Here are the instructions for making sure we are all using the same programming environments (via conda)

Any time you install a new package, follow these steps:
    Make sure your terminal is in this directory: cd ProcessedData/packageManaging
    Activate the environment to export: conda activate myenv
    Export your active environment to a new file: conda env export --no-builds > environment.yml

Any time someone on the team says they've updated the environment, or you're running code someone else wrote and it's saying a library isn't included, follow these steps:
    Create the environment from the environment.yml file (this will take a while): conda env create -f environment.yml
    If you already have the environment by that name, you'll need to delete it first with conda env remove -n ENV_NAME
